## Installing

# Method 1:

1. Open `chrome://extensions/` Make sure `Developer Mode` is on, drag, and drop the `moonlight-chrome.crx` file you downloaded from [realeses](https://github.com/moonlight-stream/moonlight-chrome/releases)

Note: This method might not work for some because of how strict Google is with none Google Store extensions. So if you can’t download the crx file or drag & drop to install See method 2.



# Method 2:

1. Rename `moonlight-chrome.crx` to `moonlight-chrome.rar` and right click it. Pick `Extract to Moonlight-chrome/`

2. When it’s done extracting move the `Moonlight-chrome/` folder somewhere you’ll remember, and not move around.
(Something like `C:\Unpacked Chrome Extensions\Moonlight-chrome` for example)

2.5. If you can’t see file extensions [here](https://www.howtohaven.com/system/show-file-extensions-in-windows-explorer.shtml)’s how to.
And if you need an extractor/compresser. Get something like
[WinRAR](http://www.rarlab.com/download.htm) or [7Zip](http://www.7-zip.org/download.html) Most likely you want the `64-bit x64` version.
But [here](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/help/827218/how-to-determine-whether-a-computer-is-running-a-32-bit-version-or-64)’s how you can check if your  PC is 32-bit or 64-bit.

3. Go to `chrome://extensions/` Make sure `Developer Mode` is on, and click `Load unpacked extension...`
Then find, and select the `Moonlight-chrome` folder you moved.
(Like the example above `C:\Unpacked Chrome Extensions\Moonlight-chrome`)

4. You should now see `Moonlight Game Streaming` Enable it if it isn’t already.
Now you can run it by clicking the blue `Launch` text under the name, and description.
You can also make a shortcut by clicking `Details` Then `Create shortcuts...` You can also run it from an [app launcher](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/apps-launcher/ijmgkhchjindcjamnckoiahagecjnkdc).
